# Condenser Thermal Simulation

The purpose of the condenser is to liquify the incoming argon gas, therefore, it must be run at a temeprature around 90K. This simulation aims to determine the cooling power required to ensure the condenser block can operate at this temperature to condense the argon gas. The condenser block will be made of copper with a 1/4" stainless steel pipe travelling through the centre which contains liquid nitrogen (LN2), this acts as the coolant of the block. The LN2 temperature will vary from 80-100K to determine the ideal operating temperature. This simulation will also consider if the heat load changes for a cylindrical and rectangular copper block.

The following assumptions were made:
- Cooling has cycled through enough to reduce the temperature gradient in LN2 so Tin = Tout.
- LN2 temperature will vary from 80-100K.
- The incoming air/argon gas will be at room temperature (293K).
- The feedthrough neck has a diameter of 1" and length of 32.54cm.
- The Cu block is about 3" wide by 1" high.
